User Interface
==============

Tray icon
---------

In order to ensure stability and user-awareness a tray icon is planned to get developed.

This may contain a way to monitor the status of the server as well as watchers.

Web Interface
-------------

In order to achieve user-friendlyness, ActivityWatch will in the future come with a web interface allowing for overview, monitoring and configuration.

This interface is likely to provide basic graphs, but more advanced and configurable visualization (such as the ones found in Zenobase and RescueTime) is not a priority and is unlikely to get implemented as a part of the core ActivityWatch project.

Before we can start work on an interface we need the core system functionality down, so this wont become a priority until then.
