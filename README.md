This repo is a bundle of the core components and official modules of ActivityWatch.

It's primary use is as a meta-package providing all the components in one repo for easier packaging and installation.

**NOTE:** While we aim to make every commit here have full compatibility between modules, we can't leave any guarantees. In the future we hope to supply stable releases but at this stage it would be premature.


## Other uses

This is also the repo where issues about ActivityWatch in general should go, such as requests and discussion regarding new features.
