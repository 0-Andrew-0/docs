Pausing logging
===============

Feature status: Planned

The possibility to pause logging is a low-tech solution to filter sensitive data.
It could most easily be implemented by instructing a watcher to simply stop logging,
such functionality might be made universal to the client libraries which would in turn
filter out all events from the pause command to the resume command.
