Filtering data
==============

Feature: Planned

ActivityWatch was born out of a frustration with the privacy issues of existing life logging solutions.
We feel that it's important that nothing gets logged that shouldn't be logged. This way the cost of data breach is bounded, and the barrier to sharing your own data for scientific purposes uses will hopefully become smaller.

This is expected to be almost impossible to perfect since what someone considers sensitive might not be for someone else (due to e.g. culture and law). But the basics are easy to get right: such as not logging private browser tabs by default.

For the ones who believe they can adequately protect their data, the option should will course be available to disable this filter.

Pausing logging is likely to get implemented before this, so if it's available and this feature isn't: Use it until we get this done.
